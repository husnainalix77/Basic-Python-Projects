# Python, OOP, ML & AI Projects  

This repository contains a collection of **Python projects** that demonstrate different programming paradigms and applications â€” from **procedural programming and object-oriented design** to **machine learning and artificial intelligence**.  

The projects range from beginner-friendly exercises to advanced implementations, serving as both a **learning resource** and a **portfolio** of practical work.  

## ðŸ“‚ Project Categories  
- **Procedural Programming** â€“ Core Python exercises, logic building, and algorithms.  
- **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** â€“ Classes, objects, inheritance, encapsulation, and design patterns.  
- **Machine Learning (ML)** â€“ Supervised and unsupervised learning, model training, evaluation, and dataset exploration.  
- **Artificial Intelligence (AI)** â€“ Search algorithms, decision-making agents, and game-playing AI.  

## ðŸš€ Getting Started  
1. Clone the repository:  
   ```bash
