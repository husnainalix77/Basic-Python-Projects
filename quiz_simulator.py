# This program is like used for online quizzes. It will pick
# MCQs from 3 different files labeled as# Easy, Medium and Hard. First MCQ
# should be from Medium file and if the user answers is wrong then next should
# come from easy otherwise from hard.This pattern should continue up till the
# end of the quiz. The user shouldn’t be aware of what difficulty level a particular MCQ belongs to.
# Each difficulty level have differentmarks.
